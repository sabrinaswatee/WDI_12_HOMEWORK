WDIConf group hack

problem statement
Student feedback and in class observation has revealed a mild disapproval for
the random student selection process during presentations.

Either by volunteering right before the randomise algorithm have finish running
or by a direct verbal attack at the randomise algorithm itself.

The size of the class since its inception has shown a steady decrease to the
point that we think democrazy will work as an option for picking on students.

We need a solution where each member of the class will have 2 votes each to
determine the presenting order for talks at WDIConf.
