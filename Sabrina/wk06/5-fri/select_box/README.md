FEWD Week # 6: Working with Arrays

Description

The team from CitiPix has reached out for iteration on their prototype. Instead of using a user's text input to change the background of the interface, the CitiPix user experience designers have asked to see how a drop-down menu would work in place of an input field. The product managers are hopeful it will also lead to less error handling for their engineers and data team. Use what you've learned this week about data-types and arrays and use the starter code - or your code from last week - and make the adjustments to your JavaScript file. Be sure to start out with Pseudocode.


Real-World Applications

Use data stored in an array to manipulate the DOM
Write pseudocode before writing any JavaScript, in order to demonstrate an understanding of interactive programming theory
Revisit applications and code you've written in the past to find solutions to problems you've already solved and iterate on a project

Technical Requirements

Create an array with the following values: "NYC", "SF", "LA", "ATX", "SYD"; use the array to add values to the <select> menu by using a for loop in JavaScript (don't update the HTML to do this!)
When the user changes the input of the drop-down, update the background image based on what they selected
Use $.append() in your iteration on the drop-down menu
Use the $.attr() function to update html classes
Get the value of user input using $.val()
Use the $.change event handler to capture user actions
Use if/else if/else conditionals to control the flow of your application
Display your pseudocode as Javascript comments
Bonus

Read up on your own and incorporate some more styles on the drop down menu
While the dropdown menu should update the page in the same way it did after your work last week, take a look at what your final product should look like with a dropdown menu:

Evaluation / Submission

Students should use the same folder and GitHub repository as the previous project ("homework-city"). When ready for evaluation they should push their code to that repository. Instructional team should evaluate against the solution code and the student's use of technical elements. They will provide a numeric grade on a scale: does not meet expectations (0); meets expectations (1); exceeds expectations (2). The maximum possible score on this assignment is 16/16. Bonus materials are completely optional.
